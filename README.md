# CSS Webring

Inspired by the CodePen challenge for the week of October 12, 2020, I used the prompt to create my first web component to embed a webring like the cool kids used to have.

You can add your CSS blog to the webring by making a pull request and adding your website title and link to `webring.json`.

## Use the `css-webring` web component

[This CodePen](https://codepen.io/5t3ph/pen/jOrbqKL) demonstrates how to use the `css-webring` web component.

You may customize the style by passing updates to the CSS custom variables as shown in the CodePen CSS panel.
